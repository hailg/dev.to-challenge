## Create your products {{ date: '2024-05-09T00:00Z' }}

This is the 1st feature that I implemented. Using Netlify Blob to store your digital products. 

It's also helpful to remind myself that even though I can use S3 for pretty much anything, I still need an app that I can just quickly store any digital products and get a link to put into my landing pages.

### <SparkleIcon /> What I want:

- A simple way to store and manage my digital products
- Minimum data input
- Quickly get a permantent link to my product

## Auto expiration links  {{ date: '2023-05-10T00:00Z' }}

I've added support for short-live download links. Sometimes, we want to create a link for a digital product that only live for a short period. I used this many times before for any email promotion campaigns I have. In those cases, my product will only be accessiable freely before an expiration date. 

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- Create short-live links for a product
- All the links a mapped into a single Blob object
- I can update product's file to a newer version without impacting any generated links. They're all mapped into the latest file.
